### Supervised Learning with Neural Network 

Input(x) | Output(x)|Application| Type|
|-|-|-|-|
Home Features| Price | Real Estate| Standard NN|
Ad, user info| Click on ad ? (0/1) | Online Advertisement | Standard NN|
Image |Object (1,....100)| Photo Tagging| CNN |

Stuctured Data = Tables 
Unstructured = Photo, Audio, text 

### Why Deep learning

The amount of new data doesnt help much in ML but DL can be improved with data unlike ML. 

Progress 
1. Data - Huge Data
2. Computation - Big data computation like spark. The more faster the more easy to make DL models
3. Algorithms -
